# Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is a famous fractal defined over the complex plane. The images of the set are generated by coloring points differentely based on how they behave over many iterations of the function $`f(z) = z^2 + c`$, where $`z`$ starts at zero and $`c`$ is a point represented as a complex number.

This project provides code to compute and visualize the Mandelbrot set, allowing exploration of its structure and properties.

## Definition

Let's call the Mandelbrot set $`\mathcal{M}`$.
Mathematically, for a point $`c \in \mathbb{C}`$ to belong to $`\mathcal{M}`$, the sequence $`(z_n)`$, defined below, must stay bounded:

```math
\begin{align*}
    z_0 &= 0 \\
    z_{n+1} &= z_n^2 + c
\end{align*}
```

That is, for all $`n \in \mathbb{N}`$, $`|z_n| < M`$ for some $`M > 0`$.

### Example

The point $`0`$ is clearly bounded, because, if we assume $`z_n = 0`$, then $`z_{n + 1} = z_n^2 + 0 = 0`$, and the base case $`z_0 = 0`$ is trivial. Therefore, $`0 \in \mathcal{M}`$. However, the point $`1`$ does not, we can see that $`(z_n) = (0, 0^2 + 1, 1^2 + 1, 2^2 + 1, \dots)`$, which grows without bound. 

## Escape on radius 2

A property that will be useful on rendering the set will be the following. A sequence reaching $`|z_n| \ge 2`$ for any $`n`$ is necessary and enough to say that the sequence diverges to infinity.
